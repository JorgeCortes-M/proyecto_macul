# Salary data of hire staff in Macul municipality

In a previous step we obtained all the data related to salary of the Macul municipality only for the hired staff. After a cleaning process, we can now work with that data in order to get some insights about the salary of hire staff between 2013 and 2022. First let's load the data.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

contrata_2013_2022_clean = pd.read_csv("../data/contrata_2013_2022_clean.csv")

contrata_2013_2022_clean.info()
```

In a first exploratory analysis we could visualize the salary without discounts and his distribution over the time.

```{python}
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.displot(data=contrata_2013_2022_clean, x='r_bruta_mens', hue='año', kind='kde')

plt.show()
```

We can see that the salary data is around \$1 million chilean pesos.

We can obtain some metrics about the data using the following.

```{python}
contrata_2013_2022_clean['r_bruta_mens'].describe()
```

The mean of the salary data between 2013 and 2022 is around **\$1.395.454** but with a standard deviation of **\$801.696**, we could segment this data per year and per estate and visualize it. First, let's segment it by year.

Another relevant issue is that in some cases the salary is equal to zero, let's look that.

```{python}
# first let's store this data in a new dataframe
zero_salary = contrata_2013_2022_clean[contrata_2013_2022_clean['r_bruta_mens']==0]

```

With the id of workers in this situation we can visualize if the same worker has zero salary over the years.

```{python}
salary_zero_salary = contrata_2013_2022_clean[contrata_2013_2022_clean["id"].isin(list(zero_salary["id"]))]

salary_zero_salary
```

```{python}
sns.boxplot(data=contrata_2013_2022_clean, x='año', y='r_bruta_mens', color='green')
plt.show()
```

We observe an increment in the salary in time. Now let's segment it by estate.

```{python}
sns.boxplot(data=contrata_2013_2022_clean, x='Estamento', y='r_bruta_mens', color='green')
plt.show()
```

We observe that the estate with better salary is "Directivo" and that the "Profesional" show a greater variation.
